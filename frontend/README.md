# Vue 3 Composition API Boilerplate

This is a minimal Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript boilerplate using the Composition API and <script setup>.

Getting started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd /Users/mac-3/projects/cleanersForYou/frontend
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

Notes
- Uses Vite and @vitejs/plugin-vue
- TypeScript config included

Verification
- I ran `npm install` and `npm run build` in this project and a production build completed successfully (output written to `dist/`).
